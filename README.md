## librespot-golang

librespot-golang is an opensource Golang library based on the [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) project, allowing you to control Spotify Connect devices, get metadata, and
play music.

This is still highly experimental and in development. Do not use it in production projects yet, as the API is incomplete and subject to heavy changes.

### Installation

This package can be installed using:
````
go get github.com/unison-music/librespot-golang
````

### Usage
To use the package look at the example micro-controller (for Spotify Connect), or micro-client (for audio playback)
